## setup the virtual environment  
> source venv/bin/activate

## run the main.py script
> source run.sh

this script renames all the .html files to .html.j2 files to make jinja2 happy then runs the build/main.py script and converts the files back to .html format
This is done for aesthetics reasons because emacs frames .html files in a nice way where it doesn't .html.j2
